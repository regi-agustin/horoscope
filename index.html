      <div class="horoscope-item"><img src="aries.png" alt="aries" /><span>Aries</span><small>Mar 21 - Apr 19</small></div>
      <div class="horoscope-fortune">
      <p class="traits">Personality Traits</p>
      <p><span class="trait-title">Strengths:</span> Courageous, determined, confident, enthusiastic, optimistic, honest, passionate</p>
      <p><span class="trait-title">Weaknesses:</span> Impatient, moody, short-tempered, impulsive, aggressive</p>
      <p><span class="trait-title">Aries likes:</span> Comfortable clothes, taking on leadership roles, physical challenges, individual sports</p>
      <p><span class="trait-title">Aries dislikes:</span> Inactivity, delays, work that does not use one's talents</p>
      <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19) loves to be number one, so itâ€™s no surprise that these audacious rams are the first sign of the zodiac. Bold and ambitious, Aries 
        dives headfirst into even the most challenging situations (which is appropriate, since the body part associated with Aries is the head). Like their fellow fire 
        signs, Leo and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. 
        Uncomplicated and direct in their approach, they often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances. They like things quick and dirty, a temperament 
        also reflected in their sexual proclivities.</p>

      <div class="horoscope-item"><img src="taurus.png" alt="taurus" /><span>Taurus</span><small>Apr 20 - May 20</small></div>

      <p><span class="trait-title">Taurus dislikes:</span> Sudden changes, complications, insecurity of any kind, synthetic fabrics</p>
      <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20) is an earth sign symbolized by the bull and ruled by Venus, the planet of love, beauty, and money. Taureans love comfort, luxury, and 
        sensual pleasures, often seeking serene and indulgent environments. While they enjoy pampering, they are also hardworking, financially savvy, and value security and 
        stability. As a fixed sign, Taurus is known for loyalty and consistency, though their dedication can sometimes be seen as stubbornness. They may stay in unhealthy 
        situations out of principle but are dependable, devoted partners and friends. Their focus on long-term rewards and steady progress defines both their professional and
         personal lives.</p>

      <p><span class="trait-title">Gemini dislikes:</span> Being alone, being confined, repetition and routine</p>
      <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20) is an air sign symbolized by the celestial twins, representing their dual nature and versatility. Geminis are naturally curious, sociable, 
        and quick-witted, often juggling multiple interests, hobbies, and social circles at once. They thrive in environments that stimulate their minds and allow them to 
        explore new ideas. With their playful energy and love for conversation, Geminis are the life of the party and can easily connect with people from all walks of life. 
        At their core, Geminis are seekers. They are constantly on the lookout for deeper meaning and connection, often feeling like somethingâ€”or someoneâ€”is missing. This 
        restless energy drives them to explore new experiences, relationships, and ideas in their pursuit of fulfillment.

      <p><span class="trait-title">Cancer dislikes:</span> Strangers, any criticism of Mom, revealing of personal life</p>
      <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22) is a cardinal water sign. Represented by the crab, this oceanic crustacean seamlessly weaves between the sea and shore, representing 
        Cancerâ€™s ability to exist in both emotional and material realms. Cancers are highly intuitive and their psychic abilities manifest in tangible spaces: This is why 
        Cancers can effortlessly pick up the energies in a room. These crabs are highly sensitive to their environments, as well as extremely self-protective. Much like 
        their celestial animal counterpart, Cancers are shielded by hard, external shells. At first, these crabs may be perceived as cold or distant. With time, though, 
        Cancers reveal their gentle nature, genuine compassion, and mystical capabilities.

      <p><span class="trait-title">Leo dislikes:</span> Being ignored, facing difficult reality, not being treated like a king or queen</p>
      <p>Leo (July 23 - August 22) is represented by the lion, and these spirited fire signs are the kings and queens of the celestial jungle. Theyâ€™re delighted to embrace 
        their royal status: Vivacious, theatrical, and passionate, Leos love to bask in the spotlight and celebrate themselves. These lions are natural leaders and they 
        enjoy cultivating friendships and romances that are artistically and creatively inspired. Playful Leos have no problem leaning into drama-fueled romances that are 
        perfectly suited for the tabloids. (In fact, they may even prefer them.) After all, every Leo perceives him or herself as a celebrity. These astrological divas never 
        get tired of lavish dinners, exclusive parties, or decadent designer wear.</p>

      <div class="horoscope-item"><img src="virgo.png" alt="virgo" /><span>Virgo</span><small>Aug 23 - Sep 22</small></div>

      <p><span class="trait-title">Virgo dislikes:</span> Rudeness, asking for help, taking center stage</p>
      <p>Virgo (August 23 - September 22) is an earth sign known for its logical, practical, and detail-oriented nature. Symbolized by the goddess of wheat, Virgo is deeply 
        connected to the material world and values structure and precision. Ruled by Mercury, Virgo focuses on analyzing and processing information, unlike Gemini's 
        expressive style. Perfectionists at heart, Virgos strive for improvement through hard work and consistency, but they must remember that imperfection is part of 
        being humanâ€”and beauty can be found in the flaws. Virgos are especially attuned to the small things that others often miss. Whether it's organizing a messy space, 
        catching errors, or offering thoughtful advice, they love making things better. Their sharp minds and grounded energy make them reliable problem-solvers and 
        supportive friends.</p>

      <p><span class="trait-title">Strengths:</span> Cooperative, diplomatic, gracious, fair-minded, social</p>
      <p><span class="trait-title">Weaknesses:</span> Indecisive, avoids confrontations, will carry a grudge, self-pity</p>
      <p><span class="trait-title">Libra likes:</span> Harmony, gentleness, sharing with others, the outdoors</p>
      <p><span class="trait-title">Libra dislikes:</span> Violence, injustice, loudmouths, conformity</p>
      <p>Libra (September 23 - October 22) is an air sign represented by the scales (interestingly, the only inanimate object of the zodiac), an association that reflects 
        Libra's fixation on balance and harmony. Libra is obsessed with symmetry and strives to create equilibrium in all areas of life. These air signs are the aesthetes 
        of the zodiac: Ruled by Venus, the planet that governs love, beauty, and money, Libras adore high art, intellectualism, and connoisseurship. Suave Libras need to 
        surround themselves with stunning objects and create environments that reflect their exquisite tastes. Accordingly, these air signs make excellent designers, 
        decorators, art critics, and stylists.</p>

      <p><span class="trait-title">Scorpio dislikes:</span> Dishonesty, revealing secrets, superficiality, small talk</p>
      <p>Scorpio (October 23 - November 21) is one of the most misunderstood signs of the zodiac. Because of its incredible passion and power, Scorpio is often mistaken 
        for a fire sign. In fact, Scorpio is a water sign that derives its strength from the psychic, emotional realm. Like its fellow water signs, Cancer and Pisces, 
        Scorpio is extremely clairvoyant and intuitive. They are passionate and assertive people with determination and focus you rarely see in other zodiac signs. They 
        will turn to in-depth research to reach the truth behind anything they find important. Great leaders and guides, Scorpios are resourceful, dedicated and fearless 
        when there is challenge to be overcome. </p>

      <p><span class="trait-title">Sagittarius likes:</span> Freedom, travel, philosophy, being outdoors</p>
      <p><span class="trait-title">Sagittarius dislikes:</span> Clingy people, being constrained, off-the-wall theories, details</p>
      <p>Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21) Curious and energetic, Sagittarius are the travelers of the zodiac. Their open mind and philosophical view motivate them to 
        wander around the world in search of the meaning of life. Sagittarius is an extrovert, always optimistic, full of enthusiasm, and ready for changes. This is a Sun 
        sign of individuals who are often preoccupied with mental work, but when they find grounding, they show their ability to transform visions and thoughts into concrete 
        actions and circumstances. Clear about their intentions and honest by moral imperative, its representatives are often honest to the point of absurd, with no regard for 
        tact and emotions of other people whatsoever. It is important for them to learn how to express their opinions in a tolerant and socially acceptable way.

      <p>Capricorn (December 22 and January 19) is a sign that represents time and responsibility, and its representatives are traditional and often very serious by nature. These individuals possess
         an inner state of independence that enables significant progress both in their personal and professional lives. They are masters of self-control and have the 
         ability to lead the way, make solid and realistic plans, and manage many people who work for them at any time. They will learn from their mistakes and get to the 
         top based solely on their experience and expertise.

      <p><span class="trait-title">Aquarius dislikes:</span> Limitations, broken promises, being lonely, dull or boring situations.</p>
      <p>Aquarius ( January 20 - February 18) is the sign different from the rest of the zodiac and people born with their Sun in it feel special. This makes them eccentric and energetic in their 
        fight for freedom, or at times shy and quiet, afraid to express their true personality. In both cases they are deep thinkers and highly intellectual people who 
        love to fight for idealistic causes. They are able to see people without prejudice and this makes them truly special. Although they can easily adapt to the energy 
        that surrounds them, Aquarius representatives have a deep need to have some time alone and away from everything in order to restore power.

      <p><span class="trait-title">Pisces dislikes:</span> Know-it-all, being criticized, the past coming back to haunt, cruelty of any kind</p>
      <p>Water sign Pisces (February 19 - March 20) is the last constellation of the zodiac. It's symbolized by two fish swimming in opposite directions, representing the 
        constant division of Pisces' attention between fantasy and reality. As the final sign, Pisces has absorbed every lessonâ€”the joys and the pains, the hopes and the 
        fearsâ€”learned by all of the other signs. This makes these fish the most psychic, empathetic, and compassionate creatures of the astrological wheel. With such immense 
        sensitivity, Pisces can easily become swallowed by emotions and must remember to stay grounded in the material realm (appropriately, Pisces rules the feet).

        <p>People born in the Year of the Rat are known for their charm, intelligence, and strong ambition. They are naturally attractive and often draw attention without 
          trying, especially from the opposite sex. Highly driven and hardworking, Rats are determined to reach their goals and are often perfectionists when it comes to 
          their work and personal achievements. They are resourceful and thrifty, especially when it comes to managing money, but can also be easily angered and prone to 
          gossip. Despite their sharp wit and occasional mood swings, Rats are incredibly focused and rarely give up on something they believe in. Their big dreams and 
          determination often lead them to success in both career and personal life. When it comes to relationships, they thrive best with those who understand their complex 
          natureâ€”making them most compatible with people born in the Year of the Dragon, Monkey, or Ox.

          carry weight and often reveal deep thought and eloquence. Oxen are hardworking, reliable, and mentally and physically alert, making them strong and steady 
          individuals. However, they can also be eccentric and quick to anger, with a fierce temper when provoked. Despite their generally calm nature, Oxen are famously 
          stubborn and dislike failure or opposition, often sticking firmly to their beliefs. Their steady presence and resilience make them dependable in both personal and 
          professional relationships. In terms of compatibility, Oxen are most harmonious with those born in the Year of the Snake, Rooster, or Rat.

        <p>People born in the Year of the Tiger are sensitive, thoughtful, and capable of deep empathy toward others. They often engage in deep thinking and have a strong 
          sense of compassion. However, they can also be extremely short-tempered and impulsive when provoked. Tigers naturally command respect and admiration, yet they may 
          often find themselves clashing with older individuals or figures of authority due to their independent nature. Tigers sometimes struggle with indecision, which can 
          lead to either rushed, poor choices or well-thought-out decisions made too late. Their suspicious nature makes them cautious of others' intentions, but they are 
          undeniably courageous and powerful in both words and actions. Their bold spirit makes them natural leaders who arenâ€™t afraid to take risks. In terms of 
          compatibility, Tigers are most harmonious with those born in the Year of the Horse, Dragon, or Dog.

        <p>People born in the Year of the Rabbit are articulate, talented, and ambitious, often admired for their refined manners and excellent taste. They are virtuous and 
          reserved, earning the trust and respect of others with ease. Financially, they tend to be quite lucky and are skilled in both personal and professional matters. 
          While they enjoy gossip, they are tactful in how they speak and generally kind-hearted, rarely losing their temper. Rabbits are clever in business and highly 
          conscientious, known for their reliability and strong sense of responsibilityâ€”they never back out of a deal once it's made. They have a natural instinct for making 
          the right choices, which would make them excellent gamblers, though they rarely take such risks due to their conservative and wise nature. In relationships,

        <p>People born in the Year of the Dragon are healthy, energetic, and full of vitality. They are excitable, short-tempered, and often quite stubborn, yet they possess 
          an honest and brave nature that inspires confidence and trust in those around them. Dragons are also highly sensitive, though they may not always show it outwardly. 
          Among the eastern zodiac signs, they are considered the most eccentric, with a unique and bold personality that sets them apart. They tend to avoid borrowing money 
          and steer clear of overly decorative or flowery speech, preferring to be direct and sincere. Despite their fiery temperament, Dragons have a surprisingly soft heart, 
          which can sometimes lead them to give others an advantage or be taken advantage of. Their strong presence and natural leadership are undeniable, and they are most

        <p>People born in the Year of the Snake are deep thinkers, known for their quiet nature and great wisdom. They often speak little but when they do, their words carry 
          weight. Financially, they are fortunate and rarely need to worry about money, thanks to their cautious and strategic approach. While they can be vain, selfish, and 
          a bit stingy at times, they also possess a surprising amount of sympathy for others and genuinely try to support those who are less fortunate. Snake individuals 
          prefer to rely on their own judgment, often doubting others, which can lead them to take on more than necessary. They are determined and focused in everything they 
          do and have a strong dislike for failure. On the outside, they may appear calm and composed, but underneath lies a deep intensity and passion. Snakes are often 
          good-looking and magnetic, though their charm can sometimes lead to relationship issues, especially due to their occasional fickleness. They are most compatible

        <p>People born in the Year of the Horse are naturally popular and full of cheerful energy. They are wise, talented, and perceptive, often displaying strong skills in 
          handling money and working with their hands. While they are charming and quick-witted, they sometimes talk more than necessary, which can occasionally get them into 
          trouble. Horses are known for having a magnetic attraction to others and may have a soft spot for romance, especially with the opposite sex. They are impatient and 
          passionate in many areas of life, except when it comes to their routine work, which they handle with surprising diligence. Horses enjoy being surrounded by people, 
          thriving in lively environments filled with entertainment and excitement. Their strong sense of independence makes them confident decision-makers, though it also

        <p>People born in the Year of the Goat are elegant, creative, and often highly accomplished in the arts. At first glance, they may appear more fortunate or well-off 
          than those born under other zodiac signs, as they carry a natural grace and charm. However, beneath their refined exterior, Goats can be shy, pessimistic, and often 
          uncertain about the direction of their lives. They are usually deeply spiritual or religious, guided by strong inner beliefs, though they tend to be timid by nature. 
          While they might sometimes come across as awkward or clumsy in speech, their sincerity and passion shine through in everything they do. Goats are deeply committed 
          to their values and pursuits, and their talents often bring them financial success, allowing them to enjoy the finer things in life. Wise, gentle, and compassionate, 
          they are known for their kindness and nurturing spirit. In relationships, they are most compatible with those born in the Year of the Rabbit, Pig, or Horse.

      <div class="zodiac-fortune">
        <p>People born in the Year of the Monkey are the erratic geniuses of the zodiac, known for their remarkable inventiveness, cleverness, and skill. They are highly 
          flexible and original, able to solve even the most difficult problems with ease. There are few areas in which they wouldnâ€™t be successful due to their natural 
          talent, but their tendency to be overly agreeable can sometimes work against them. Monkeys are driven to start things immediately, and if they canâ€™t get going right 
          away, they can become discouraged and abandon their projects. Though they are good at making decisions, Monkeys have a habit of looking down on others, believing 
          their solutions are often superior. They possess common sense and a deep thirst for knowledge, coupled with an excellent memory. Strong-willed, they are capable of 
          pushing through obstacles, but their temper is quick to flare and just as quickly subsides. In relationships, Monkeys are most compatible with those born in the Year 
          of the Dragon and Rat.</p>

      <div class="zodiac-fortune">
        <p>People born in the Year of the Rooster are deep thinkers, highly capable, and exceptionally talented. They thrive when busy and are deeply devoted to their work, 
          often feeling disappointed if they fail to meet their high expectations. Roosters tend to be eccentric individuals, which sometimes leads to challenging 
          relationships with others. They often believe they are right, and more often than not, they are. Despite this confidence, Roosters can be loners, and while they 
          give the impression of being adventurous, they are often more timid than they appear. Their emotions, much like their fortunes, can swing dramatically from high to 
          low, making them unpredictable at times. Roosters can be selfish and too outspoken, but they are never boring. They are also capable of extreme bravery when the 
          situation calls for it, often stepping up in moments of need. In relationships, Roosters are most compatible with those born in the Year of the Ox, Snake, or Dragon.

           somewhat selfish, terribly stubborn, and occasionally eccentric in their behavior. While they donâ€™t care much for wealth, they often seem to find themselves with
            money despite their indifference to it. Emotionally, they can be a bit cold and distant, especially in social settings like parties, where they may come off as 
            aloof. Dogs are known for their critical nature and sharp tongues, often finding fault with things others may overlook. Despite these occasional flaws, they are 
            strong leaders, respected for their integrity and decision-making. In relationships, Dogs are most compatible with those born in the Year of the Horse, Tiger, or 
            Rabbit.</p>
